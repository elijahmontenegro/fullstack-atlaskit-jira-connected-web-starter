### Backend
If you don't already have a Atlassian Jira platform setup you can get started here: https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-software&edition=free

#### OAuth 2.0 (3LO) Setup
 1. Head over to https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/
 2. Create a 'OAuth 2.0 integration' app.
 3. Add permissions for 'Jira platform REST API' and 'User identity API'.

#### Launching the Backend Server
1. Take a look at the *.env.sample* and *docker-compose.sample.yml* provided. 
2. Edit your *docker-compose.yml* and *.env*.
3. `docker-compose up -d` to set up the environment
4. `npm run dev`


### Frontend
Parcel v2 is in beta and has some problems with Yarn so you would be advised to use NPM.
