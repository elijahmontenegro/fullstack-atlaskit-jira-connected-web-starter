# Shtick Full-stack web app
Production is not ready
App is very WIP but demonstrates using the following technologies: sequelize, postgres, parcel, graphql, apollo, passport (for oauth 2.0 strategies) and soon hopefully redis

# How to use
- Frontend: Use NPM as Parcel V2 currently has problems with Yarn
- Backend: npm run dev

## Set up the databases

The entire environment can run on Docker.
```
# Starting postgres, redis and redis-commander
docker-compose up -d
```
